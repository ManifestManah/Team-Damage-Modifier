# [Team Damage Modifier]
## About
This plugin was designed to compliment friendly fire settings. With it enabled on your server it creates a FaceIt-like team damage environment, where molotovs, incendiary and high explosive grenades will be able to inflict damage upon your teammates.
If you only want this to be enabled on certain maps or in certain game modes, simply set the cvar Manifest_TeamDamageModifier to 0 to disable it, or set it to Manifest_TeamDamageModifier 1 to enable it.
